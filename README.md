# CS230-Deep-Learning

I have already completed the [Coursera Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/65BTGUH73U6U), so for this course I did the following:

* reviewed those courses
* watched the youtube videos
* tried to use what I learned and implement models on a dataset I had collected to complete a research project of mine
